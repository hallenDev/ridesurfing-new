            Ride via the Site, Application and Services based upon the
            information provided in your Posting. You understand and agree
            that once a Ridesurfer requests a booking of your Ride, you may

            or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations.
            Ridesurfing reserves the right, at any time and without prior

            If you are a Driver, you understand and agree that Ridesurfing
            does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a
            Ridesurfer requests a booking of your Ride and travels using your
            Ride, any agreement you enter into with such Ridesurfer is between
            you and the Ridesurfer and Ridesurfing is not a party to it.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ridesurfing Payment Processing
            third party vendors serve as the limited authorized payment
            collection agent of the Driver for the purpose of accepting, on
            behalf of the Driver, payments from Ridesurfers of such amounts
            stipulated by the Driver (including transportation fees and/or Taxes).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When you create a Posting, you may also choose to include certain
            requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to
            request a booking of your Ride, such as requiring Members to have
            a profile picture, verified phone number or meet specific travel
            preferences such as non- smoking, no pets allowed or kid friendly,
            in order to book your Ride. Any Member wishing to book Ride included
            in Postings with such requirements must meet these requirements.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you are a Driver, Ridesurfing makes certain tools available to
            you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you
            choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Ride. You
            acknowledge and agree that, as a Driver, you are responsible for
            your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts
            and omissions of any individuals you travel with or are otherwise
            present during the Ride at your request or invitation, excluding
            the Ridesurfer (and the individuals the Ridesurfer invites to
            the Ride, if applicable)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ridesurfing recommends that Drivers obtain appropriate insurance
            for their Rides. Please review any insurance policy that you may
            have for your Ride carefully, and in particular please make sure
            that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and
            any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including,
            but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover
            the actions or inactions of Ridesurfers (and if the Ridesurfer
            is covered on your auto insurance if the Ridesurfer helps with
            driving, if applicable) while on travel with you.

            "Ride Fees" means the amounts that are due and payable by a
            Ridesurfer in exchange for that Ridesurfer’s travel in such
            Ride. The Driver alone, and not Ridesurfing, is responsible for
            the Ride Fees for his or her Posting. The Driver may in his or
            her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) Taxes
            that the Driver determines that he or she has to collect.
            <br/>
            "Ridesurfer Fees" means the fee that Ridesurfing charges a
            Ridesurfer for the use of the Services, which is calculated
            as a percentage of the applicable Ride Fees. The Ridesurfer
            Fees will be displayed to the Ridesurfer when the Ridesurfer
            is asked whether to send a booking request to a Driver.
            <br/>
            "Driver Fees" means the fee that Ridesurfing charges a Driver for

            the Driver when the Driver is asked whether to confirm or reject
            a booking request from a prospective Ridesurfer.
            <br/>
            "Services" means the Ride, Driver, other Ridesurfers, and any
            other information or materials provided by Ridesurfing separate

            Driver Fees.
            <br/>

            <b><u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Drivers</u></b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you are a Driver and a booking is requested for your Ride via
            the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either
            confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request
            Period, otherwise the booking request will automatically expire.
            When a booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services,
            we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the
            Ridesurfer who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the
            Ridesurfer’s Ridesurfing Account profile page, (iii) if the
            Ridesurfer and Driver have both connected their Ridesurfing
            accounts to SNS, the names of any members of an SNS with whom you
            are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also
            "friends" or associated with the Ridesurfer on such SNS, and (iv)
            an indication of whether or not the Ridesurfer has provided other
            information to Ridesurfing, such as a verified email address, connection
            to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to
            reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amount
            collected by Ridesurfing for the requested booking will be refunded to
            the applicable Ridesurfer’s credit card and any pre-authorization of
            such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking
            requested by a Ridesurfer, Ridesurfing will send you an email,
            text message or message via the Application confirming such booking,
            depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application
            and Services.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ridesurfing’s third party Payment Processors will collect the
            Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the
            Driver confirms the booking request) and will initiate payment
            of the Ride Fees (less Ridesurfing’s Driver Fees and any Taxes
            in respect of the Driver Fees, such as VAT in Europe) to the Driver
            within 24 hours of when the Ridesurfer arrives at the applicable
            Ride (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Ridesurfer).
            The time it takes for the Driver to receive payouts may depend upon
            the payout method chosen by the Driver. Some methods involve the
            use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own
            additional charges for the use of their services on the Driver,
            including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you owe or agree to pay any amount via Ridesurfing’s third
            party Payment Processors to Ridesurfing (whether as a result of
            your bookings or actions as a Ridesurfer or otherwise), then
            Ridesurfing Payment Processing third party vendor may (but is
            not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Ridesurfing from
            any payout amounts due to you as a Driver, and use the withheld
            amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Ridesurfing. If
            Ridesurfing Payment Processing third party vendor does so, then
            your obligation to pay Breeae will be extinguished to the extent
            of the amount withheld by Ridesurfing’s third party Payment
            Processors and Ridesurfing will cease to owe to you any obligations
            (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with
            respect to the amount withheld. In addition to the amount due,
            if your account is delinquent or you otherwise have chargebacks
            on your account, you may be charged fees that are incidental to
            our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such
            fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees, or
            other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all
            communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by
            electronic mail or by phone, as provided to Ridesurfing by you.
            Such communication may be made by Ridesurfing or by anyone on its
            behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.

            for the purpose of accepting the Ride Fees from Ridesurfers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Each Driver agrees that payment made by a Ridesurfer through
            Ridesurfing’s third party Payment Processors, shall be considered
            the same as a payment made directly to the Driver, and the Driver

            manner as if the Driver has received the Ride Fees. Each Driver
            agrees that Ridesurfing may, in accordance with the cancellation
            policy selected by the Driver and reflected in the relevant Posting,
            (i) permit the Ridesurfer to cancel the booking and (ii) refund

            that portion of the Ride Fees specified in the applicable cancellation

            Payment Processors accepts payments from Ridesurfers as the
            Driver’s limited payment collection agent and that Ridesurfing’s
            third party Payment Processors obligation to pay the Driver is
            subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the
            associated payments from Ridesurfers. Ridesurfing does not
            guarantee payments to Driver for amounts that have not been
            successfully received by Ridesurfing’s third party Payment
            Processors from Ridesurfers. In accepting appointment as the
            limited authorized agent of the Driver, Ridesurfing’s third party
            Payment Processors assumes no liability for any acts or omissions
            of the Driver.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Please note that Ridesurfing does not currently charge fees for
            the creation of Postings. However, you as a Driver acknowledge and

            The Drivers, not Ridesurfing, are solely responsible for honoring
            any confirmed bookings and making available any Rides reserved
            through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a
            Ridesurfer, choose to enter into a transaction with a Driver for
            the booking of an Ride, you agree and understand that you will be
            required to enter into an agreement with the Driver and you agree
            to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated
            with such Ride imposed by the Driver. You acknowledge and agree that
            you, and not Ridesurfing, will be responsible for performing the
            obligations of any such agreements, that Ridesurfing is not a party
            to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment
            obligations hereunder, Ridesurfing disclaims all liability arising
            from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree
            that, notwithstanding the fact that Ridesurfing is not a party to
            the agreement between you and the Driver, Ridesurfing’s third party
            Payment Processors acts as the Driver’s payment collection agent for
            the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the
            Driver. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Ridesurfing’s third
            party Payment Processors, your payment obligation to the Driver for
            the Ride Fees is extinguished, and Ridesurfing’s third party Payment
            Processors is responsible for remitting the Ride Fees (less the
            Driver Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Driver Fees, such as
            VAT in Europe), in the manner described in these Terms. In the
            event that Ridesurfing’s third party Payment Processors does not
            remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Driver
            will have recourse only against such Ridesurfing entity.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Ridesurfer before
            the Ridesurfer sends a booking request to a Driver. As noted
            above, the Driver is required to either confirm or reject the
            booking request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise,
            the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a
            requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the
            applicable Driver), any amounts collected by Ridesurfing’s
            third party Payment Processors will be refunded to such
            Ridesurfer, depending on the selections the Ridesurfer
            makes via the Site and Application, and any pre- authorization
            of such Ridesurfer’s credit card will be released, if applicable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You as a Ridesurfer agree to pay Ridesurfing for the Total Fees
            for any booking requested in connection with your Ridesurfing
            Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable
            Driver. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable
            Driver’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand
            and agree that Ridesurfing’s third party Payment Processors, on
            behalf of the Driver, reserve the right, in its sole discretion,
            to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the
            Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not
            to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in
            which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound),
            to verify your credit card. As a general rule, Ridesurfing’s third
            party Payment Processors will collect the Total Fees due once
            Ridesurfing receives confirmation of your booking from the
            applicable Driver; if necessary, Total Fees may instead be
            collected at a later point. Please note that Ridesurfing cannot
            control any fees that may be charged to a Ridesurfer by his or
            her bank related to Ridesurfing’s collection of the Total Fees,
            and Ridesurfing disclaims all liability in this regard.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to
            provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information to Ridesurfing’s third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Ridesurfing for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Ridesurfing Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Ridesurfing to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Ride as contemplated under "Damage to Rides" below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Ridesurfings’ third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.

If a Security Deposit is included in a Posting for a confirmed booking of an Ride, and a Driver makes a claim against such Security Deposit, Ridesurfing’s third party payment processor(s) will, in its capacity as the payment collection agent of the Driver, use its commercially reasonable efforts to charge the Ridesurfer’s payment method in the amount of the Security Deposit, within a reasonable period of time after the Ridesurfer’s travels from the Driver’s Ride. Ridesurfing will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Driver’s requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Ridesurfing is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Drivers related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.

Ridesurfing third-party processor(s) deducts the Driver Fees from the Ride Fees before remitting the balance to the Driver as described in these Terms. Ridesurfer Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            If, as a Driver, your Ridesurfer cancels a confirmed booking or Ridesurfing decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking, and Ridesurfing issues a refund to the Ridesurfer in accordance with the Ridesurfer Refund Policy or other applicable cancellation policies, you agree that in the event you have already been paid Ridesurfing shall be entitled to recover the amount of any such Ridesurfer refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Ride Fees due to you.

          <h6>Recurring Payments</h6>
          <div className="content">
            In some instances, Ridesurfers may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her Ride (collectively, "Recurring Payments"). More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable. If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed booking, then the Ridesurfer authorizes Ridesurfing Payments, on behalf of the Driver, to collect the Total Fees and the Driver agrees that such Ridesurfing entity will initiate payouts to the Driver, in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, each as identified on the Site, Application and Services.

            Ridesurfing may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Ridesurfers or Drivers to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Ridesurfing will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00. Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Ridesurfing may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Ridesurfing to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.

          <h6>Damage to the Ride Vehicle</h6>
          <div className="content">
            As a Ridesurfer, you are responsible for leaving the Ride vehicle or means of transportation (“Ride Vehicle”) in the condition it was in at the beginning of your trip. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Ridesurfer, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions. In the event that a Driver claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of the damages. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Ridesurfing Account. Ridesurfing also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Ridesurfing Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Ridesurfing in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Ridesurfing's sole discretion, to have damaged any Ride, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Drivers under the Ridesurfing Driver Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Ridesurfing to Drivers. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Ride to the applicable Driver or to Ridesurfing (if applicable). Both Ridesurfers and Drivers agree to cooperate with and assist Ridesurfing in good faith, and to provide Ridesurfing with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Ridesurfing, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Rides or any personal or other property located at an Ride (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Ridesurfing Driver Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Ridesurfing or a representative of Ridesurfing regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Ridesurfer, upon Ridesurfing's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Driver, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Ridesurfing or a third party selected by Ridesurfing or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Driver is requesting payment from Ridesurfing under the Ridesurfing Driver Guarantee.

            <br/>
            If you are a Ridesurfer, you understand and agree that Ridesurfing may make a claim under your auto insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Ride or any personal or other property located at an Ride (including without limitation amounts paid by Ridesurfing under the Ridesurfing Driver Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Ridesurfing in good faith, and to provide Ridesurfing with such information as may be reasonably requested by Ridesurfing, in order to make a claim under your auto insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Ridesurfing may reasonably request to assist Ridesurfing in accomplishing the foregoing.

          <h6>Holdover: Overstaying without the Driver's Consent</h6>
          <div className="content">
          Ridesurfers agree that a confirmed reservation is merely a license granted by the Driver to the Ridesurfer to enter and ride with the Driver for a limited duration of the confirmed final destination on the posting and in accordance with the Ridesurfer's agreement with the Driver. Ridesurfers further agree to leave the Ride no later than the checkout time that the Driver specifies in the Posting or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Driver and Ridesurfer. If a Ridesurfer stays past the agreed upon confirmation or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Driver and Ridesurfer without the Driver's consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Ride and the Driver is entitled to make the Ridesurfer leave. In addition, Ridesurfers agree that the Driver can charge the Ridesurfer, for each one hour period that the Ridesurfer stays over the agreed period without the Ridesurfers consent, an additional trips fee of two times the average distance Ride Fee originally paid by the Ridesurfer to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Driver, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Driver to make the Ridesurfer leave (collectively, "Additional Sums"). Ridesurfers agree that Ridesurfing third-party payment processor(s), in its role as limited collection agent for the Driver, shall charge the Ridesurfer's credit card or other payment methods it has on file to collect these Additional Sums. In addition, Ridesurfing third-party payment processor(s) may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Additional Sums by charging the Ridesurfer's credit card or other payment method on file.
