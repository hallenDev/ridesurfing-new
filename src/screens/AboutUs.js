            <h6>Who is Ridesurfing for?</h6>
            <div className="content">
              Ridesurfing is unique in that it accommodates different travel
              goals people may have. There are two types of rides:
              <div className="ml20 mt10">
                <b>Commute:</b> A "commute" is for those interested in getting
                to a defined destination within a specified period of time.
              </div>
              <div className="ml20">
                <b>Adventure:</b> An "adventure" is for those less concerned
                about defined plans and more interested in the exploration of
                travel. Another reason to use this option is if youâ€™re waiting
                for an ideal traveling partner to be interested in your trip.
              </div>
              <br/>
              Also, Ridesurfing allows drivers to ask for money for the trip,
              or to set the price of their trip to $0, depending on the goals
              and motivations of the driver.

            <h6>How did Ridesurfing come to be?</h6>
            <div className="content">
              We realized that many cars on the road had empty seats, which
              seemed an inefficient way for people to travel. Ridesurfing has
              a goal of minimizing the number of cars on the road, decreasing
              emissions, and most importantly increasing human connection while
              people travel on their journey
